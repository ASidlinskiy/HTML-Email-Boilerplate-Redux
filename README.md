## HTML Email Boilerplate:

The HTML Email Boilerplate is designed to create a solid foundation for any email campaign by fixing various email client quirks from the beginning. (Saving headaches later!)

There are various email boilerplate templates around, however Central College Nottingham as adapted its own template from a variety of sources as well our own additions based on our own research and development. All sources have been credited accordingly where required by using the original source (URL) of where the code/information was found.

## Usage:

You will find three HTML documents:

* htmlemail-boilerplate-stable-with-guidelines.html
* htmlemail-boilerplate-stable-without-guidelines.html
* htmlemail-boilerplate-experimental-without-guidelines.html

The version *with* guidelines is designed for learning and basically explains every part of the template in details.

The version *without* guidelines is the version you should use in your own email campaign

The *experimental* version is for testing purposes, code may change regularly here, and should not be used in any live campaign (Use the stable, without guidelines)

**Never use the commented version in a live email campaign, as HTML comments play havoc with spam filters and also the structure of the commented version is not friendly for parsing!**

The default table structure defined in the template is provided as guidance, you may wish to adapt it for your own uses.
